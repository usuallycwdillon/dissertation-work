Did you know that Rome is over 2,700 years old? Rome wasn't even the first state-like civilization in the world.  There were also Sumer (in Mesopotamia), Harappa (in the Indus valley), Erlitou (in China)... State-like polities have existed for thousands of years. 

Through the social sciences and humanities we have a good outline of the story of social development around the world and how societies have interacted over time.

For example, the world order we are familiar with today: the society of `nation-states' has existed for only a few hundred years; since the early 18th century. A change in world order is inevitable. Historically, it coincides with war.

Measuring by total combat deaths, the largest wars go hand-in-hand with shifts in world order and significant changes in social development. Because of rapid global transportation and the advent of the Internet, unprecedented and uneven social change is already under way.

Statistical analysis of the size and onset of wars over the past 500 years indicates that we are long over-due for the next "biggest war ever". In fact, we are so long overdue that we are nearly due again. 

So, is it possible for societies to develop and world order to change without war? What policies or institutions would make that possible?

I am developing a laboratory to simulate long-term, global social change and study alternative, future world orders. It's a way to study patterns of change, test intervention policies; and, study the effects of our collective social behaviors.

The core of my project is to develop a computer simulation that can support strategic thinking about complex and inter-connected global issues.

The model design and its software instantiation will be modular and extensible to enable long-term evolution and to be a common basis for experiments with competing theories from the various social science disciplines.

Global-level simulation models like this are not new. Previous attempts have fallen short of expectations, not necessarily because the social science was under-developed but because computing power was overly-limiting. The world is really big!

There has been a `big data' revolution in computer science. We have better simulation techniques. Social science is also much more advanced. These are sufficient reasons to warrant a new generation of global-scale models. 

My simulation laboratory will be a step forward for policy-making and social science research.
