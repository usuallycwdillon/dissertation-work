This is an umbrella repo for my dissertation research. Some repos will remain private until they are ready to be shared. 

The general organization of the project includes:
* a Proposal 
* a Working Paper
* my 3 Minute Thesis presentation
* a simple Model of World Order (a demonstration of the concept)
* GEORGE
  - a Generator for Experiments on the Order of Relations in a Global Environment
  - it should go with MASON
  - this work is being done at George Mason University
  - because I feel very much attached to the project, _a la_ [Looney Tunes](https://youtu.be/ArNz8U7tgU4?t=10)
